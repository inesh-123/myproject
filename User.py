About 10% to 15% of actinic keratoses eventually change into squamous cell cancers of the skin. It is a small bump that feels like sandpaper or a small, scaly patch of sun-damaged skin that has a pink, red, yellow or brownish tint."+"It's also known as a solar keratosis\n\n"+"Prevention:\n\n"+"Limit your time in the sun.\nCover up\nUse sunscreen\nAvoid tanning beds\nCheck your skin regularly and report changes to your health care provider.\n\n")

BCC most often occurs when DNA damage from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or indoor tanning triggers changes in basal cells in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis), resulting in uncontrolled growth.\n\n"+"It’s important to note that BCCs can look quite different from one person to another. \n\n")

This type of skin growth does tend to run in families, so there is likely an inherited tendency.\n If you've had one seborrheic keratosis, you're at risk of developing others.\n\n"+"A seborrheic keratosis is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumour that originates from cells, namely keratinocytes, in the outer layer of the skin called the epidermis. Like liver spots, seborrheic keratoses are seen more often as people age\n\n")

There are three major categories of vascular lesions: Hemangiomas, Vascular Malformations, and Pyogenic Granulomas. While these birthmarks can look similar at times, they each vary in terms of origin and necessary treatment.\n\n"+"Injury to the vessel walls byb bacteria or by virus.\n\nOccures at birthmarks too.\n\n")

Melanomas commonly appear on the legs of women. The number one place they develop on men is the trunk. Keep in mind, though, that melanomas can arise anywhere on the skin, even in areas where the sun doesn’t shine.\n\n"+"65% of this type of skin disease is occured due to sun exposure (or) by UV light.\n\n")
